Any news, Cyphr?

...the answer doesn't change in thirty seconds. She's still unconscious, sir.
#TEXT_END

#CHARA_MUGSHOT chara_cyphr\Mesh5
#TEXT_BEGIN
At least, she's breathing regularly.
#TEXT_END

#CHARA_MUGSHOT chara_tiger\Mesh2
#TEXT_BEGIN
Yeah, at least...

Anyway, sir... wasn't that creepy?

What? Amy being the Night Assassin, the whole "extra-dimensional" teleport that you experienced...
#TEXT_END

#CHARA_MUGSHOT chara_tiger\Mesh2
#TEXT_BEGIN
...~ or the fact that everyone else froze in place until we managed to take her out of the hospital?
#TEXT_END

#CHARA_MUGSHOT chara_cyphr\Mesh5
#TEXT_BEGIN
Yeah, the last one. The soldiers were not seeing us, it's like we were like ghosts to them. And we escaped like thieves.
#TEXT_END

#CHARA_MUGSHOT chara_cyphr\Mesh5
#TEXT_BEGIN
I followed your orders, sir, but... can you explain me why we didn't report the incident to General Boost?
#TEXT_END
#END

#CHARA_MUGSHOT chara_tiger\Mesh2
#TEXT_BEGIN
There are records of Amy turning into the Night Assassin. Boost would have kept her captive for further experimentation. I... I just...
#TEXT_END
#END

#CHARA_MUGSHOT chara_cyphr\Mesh5
#TEXT_BEGIN
...jeez, you really got a crush on her, sir? Fair enough, I wouldn't have left Lejl to die there anyway.

Lejl? Who's Lejl?
#TEXT_END

#CHARA_MUGSHOT chara_cyphr\Mesh5
#TEXT_BEGIN
The only part of Amy that I can someway relate to without wanting to break her neck. She's not the Night Assassin, she's just an additional... layer, we can say.
#TEXT_END
#END

#CHARA_MUGSHOT chara_cyphr\Mesh5
#TEXT_BEGIN
It was more clarifying to talk to her for a few minutes than to interrogate this sleeping brat for half an hour. I'm kinda sad she's not her usual personality, we could get along much better.
#TEXT_END

#CHARA_MUGSHOT chara_tiger\Mesh2

In other words, you have a crush on her.

WHAT?! I'm not into girls! Not at all! And, even if I were, not in the blond-haired gold-eyed glowing-skin reality-altering kind!
#TEXT_END

#CHARA_MUGSHOT chara_tiger\Mesh2
#TEXT_BEGIN
*laughs* That's quite a specific denial.

#CHARA_MUGSHOT chara_cyphr\Mesh5

Oh, finally a smile! Was it so hard, sir?
#TEXT_END

#CHARA_MUGSHOT chara_tiger\Mesh2

Yeah, I hadn't much time to smile, lately. Too many... unpleasant nightmares.
