I don't know if I can trust this woman. She's gorgeous, and she's got some curves, sure, but she's someway... creepy.

Mayer was the head of the Schwarzer Blitz project. He was the person your brother was tasked to get out of the lab alive. Unsuccesfully, we could add.

Schwarzer Blitz. It's German, it means "black lightning". I think Mayer came up with the name himself.

Normally, I would agree with you... but, you see, Mayer had something to explain. The authorities wanted him, and they noticed that he didn't evacuate the facility after the first explosion.

Precisely. As you may know, they are throwing a memorial party next week in Euterpe to celebrate the success of the cleanup operation. All the relatives of the firefighters who died in the accident are invited.
