That's... strange. Every time I hit him, I feel like I'm punching a bag of flies. His body is not reacting like a human body would.

I am indeed human, Miss Husler. Only, I made peace with reality and started building my own one. We are part of two different paradigms, therefore we can barely interact with each other.

Indeed, you two are the protagonists, and I am but an external observer who rejoices in watching your story. There is a fourth wall between us, which lets me enjoy it even more, as I can see without being seen.

A cyborg-tiger-thing-y?! No, this is too absurd! I mean, in one day I've met a horribly dressed guy without a face, a swarm of haemophages, a shadow-walker, two kitsune sex-dolls, an insane punching bag... and now, this?
