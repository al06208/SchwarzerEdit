There's something strange about her, Cyphr.

Two weeks ago, the Night Assassin claimed their last victims: those girls' last living relatives. Then, she disappeared, never to strike again.

Apparently, not. Yesterday, the Night Assasin has been spotted again, though she didn't murder anybody. I have received a report from the St.Patrick police dept just half an hour ago.

Therefore, I have to gather more intel on her. This is why I accepted.

Oh, silly me! And I was thinking you were going on a date with a girl you've just met twice, after you've found her naked on the street and been with her for the whole night when she was unconscious in a hospital bed!

You should change your nickname. "Die Schlange" sounds more appropriate than "Das Wolfm:ae:dchen".
