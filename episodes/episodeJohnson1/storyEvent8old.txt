We are near the Irish coast. In some ten minutes we will dock in a safe haven near the dead city, Johnson. From there, you'll be able to go wherever you need to. Just do not cross my road again, 'kay?

Crystal clear, Mister Aural. But, alas, I will probably need your services one more time to leave the island.

That's not a big issue, provided we don't meet in person.

I just want to ask you something, before we part ways: how did you best the lobster? You can be an excellent fighter, but with his carapace I find it hard that you managed to hurt him.

You miss the small details, Mister Aural. The lobster was wearing sunglasses at night. So, there was no possibilty that he was relying only on his eyes to track me.

At the beginning, when he charged at me, I grabbed his antennas and twisted them, you saw that, right?

...you basically damaged his sensory apparatus.

That was only temporary, but combined with a couple kicks to the head, I managed to make him suffer balance issues. Therefore, he fell as a dead body, even if I did little to no damage to him.
