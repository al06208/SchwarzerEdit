"Hell, no! Stop! If you shoot, it's like calling the police and telling them "hey guys, can you please take us under arrest?"."
changed to
"Hell no! Stop! Shooting now would be like calling the police and telling them, "Hey guys, could you please arrest us?""
original was a little awkward, so I tried to get the same basic idea across with more natural english
