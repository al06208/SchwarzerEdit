Maybe "accident" is not the right word. I believe "deliberate massacre" is more accurate.

Pretty B-movie-ish, if you ask me, but who am I to judge? In any case, three million people died. Now, Northern Algol is something like an open-air graveyard. A bunch of lifeless ruins.

People used to travel there to make cheap "found footate" movies. Heck, there was a horror series filmed there a couple months ago. The truth is, Northern Algol is still dangerous. Those damn flowers never withered.

Except the news said something about an unknown military robot being spotted there. Another thing that surely shouldn't be walking the dead streets of a deader city.

Reaching Ireland means ferry or airplane. Ferry or airplane means identity card. And technically, I don't have one, since I don't exist.
