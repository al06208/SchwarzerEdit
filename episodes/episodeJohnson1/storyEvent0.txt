A world where - as usual - I can walk without anyone caring about me.
Everyone is just randomly moving about like a fly, following neon lights without a precise path.

Sometimes I wonder... how did we get to this point?
How come people just mind their own business, without even taking a glance at what's happening around them?

Maybe I'm just brooding too much. Please, feel free to contradict me at any time.
I 'll just leave you one further question to help you formulate an answer.

That's right. Nobody can remember my face. Not even me, while I'm looking in the mirror. Everyone sees it as an indistinguishable mess of ever-changing, fading... stuff.

Like a photograph completely out of focus. Only the eyes are where they are supposed to be. Except they don't look like eyes. Just less blurry areas on a blurred portrait.

It's like everyone - me included - is suffering from some sort of prosopagnosia when looking at it. Feel free to look through a medical encyclopedia, I have time.

But in any case, it doesn't matter. Nowadays, people don't give a damn about you, except for the occasional random weirdo that starts insulting you without a reason...

Fortunately, there is a nice, small ladder nearby to reach the riverside. It's actually used by sanitation workers to store waste. Nobody in his right mind would go down there now.
