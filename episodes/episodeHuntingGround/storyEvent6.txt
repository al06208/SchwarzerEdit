We recently acquired a specimen that, unfortunately, managed to escape by yet to be determined means.

We put a tracker and a microphone on the car which was used to move the specimen, as it is a standard procedure to track all vehicles coming here. We know where they are going and when.

However, the specimen was not "officially recorded" for reasons you don't need to know. Therefore, we have no legal leverage to get it back. A bounty is also out of question, as it would gather unwanted attention.

We need a renegade who could retrieve it for us, without direct military intervention. Someone who can't be connected with us, at least officially.

Yes, but with a catch: the first activation will last for 72h. If you don't manage to get the specimen back or to give a minimal contribution, you will be forcefully switched off.
