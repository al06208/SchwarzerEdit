I'm indeed fully aware of it. No, this robot here asked me if he could join our little meeting. The reason is simple: he wants a V.146b yrite hybrid reactor, and I'm convinced it's something that you gentlefish could find for a reasonable price.

Some months ago, one of us went AWOL. Name's Shaz Colder, but he went also by the name of Shaz Aliart or Gaetano Trasimeno. We know where he hides, but we can't take him ourselves, as there are some... influential people protecting him.

As a result, the don thought that a maverick would have more chances than us and put a thirty thousand pounds bounty on his head. Money that we would prefer to spare, if possible.

Yes, in short that's the deal: we take you to New Langdon, you track down the shark before any other bounty hunter and, as a compensation, we will find the reactor you need. It will be cheaper than paying for the bounty.
