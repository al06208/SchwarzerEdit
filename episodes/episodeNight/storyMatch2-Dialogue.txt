Amy? What the heck is going on here?!
Amy 0 2000
When there is no more sunlight,
Amy 0 2000
You can see Her with your eyes.
Amy 0 2000
Can deny it, yes, you might...
Amy 0 2000
But She's still the Walking Night!

Cyphr 500 3000
This rhyme... no, it can't be!
Amy 400 2000
When the clock is striking twelve,
Amy 0 2000
All the dead exhume themselves,
Amy 0 2000
Then come back to life and cry,
Amy 0 2000
While the Moon's high in the sky!

Cyphr 500 3000
Verdammte Schei...! This can't be!
Amy 400 2000
Wind is twisting leaves and grass,
Amy 0 2000
Can you hear their scream, their voice?
Amy 0 2000
It sounds like a judgement brass...
Amy 0 2000
Come back home, you have no choice!

Cyphr 500 3000
So... so you truly are...
