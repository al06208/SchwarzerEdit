Ten years ago, when I was still a kid, I was scheduled to be vivisected here. Hadn't my mother saved me...

I've heard about it. The doctors here are just a bunch of butchers. I was scared when they told me that Amy was taken here.

I wanted to apologize for the inappropriate behavior of my underlings. The kidnap was not approved by either me or Go Ottari. Feliz and the lobster acted on their own will.

Spare me the act, Aural. Everybody knows that I'm on the black list of the Fishface Crime Syndicate since the moment I have put some defectors under protection.

Just one word of caution, though. We owe you one here, Sambiong, but you shouldn't interfere with the Syndicate...
