Calm down, Cyphy. I told you, I'm not an assassin. I'm just... a personification of Aylin's self-preservation instinct.

Let's put this straight, shall we? I didn't attack you because I had a choice to do so. It just happens that you are currently a threat to Aylin's future and well-being.

You know, if you would report your findings to Tiger or to the army, Aylin would be in serious troubles. Still, I'm... restraining myself from eliminating you now. I need you alive.

No, there's still something... wrong. The Night Assassin was always talking about her "darling Walking Night", how she was killing to "purify the Night"...

I admit I got inspired by the story of "Jack the Ripper". It was a nice way to rationalize the fact that I basically kill people in cold blood. It added also a bit of flavour.

The nursery rhyme, the random blabbering about "the purity of the Night", the Night here, the Night there! So much for a stroke of modern folklore! Isn't it exciting?
