That was a nice show of skill, Miss Husler. It's hard to believe that you are just a journalist traveling the Dead Zone for a reportage.

Those were military-level self defense techniques. Could you please tell me the truth about yourself?

What about first telling me why I can't "read" your face, Johnson? What about that?

One answer for one answer? Fine with me. As you may have noticed, I have no face, Miss Husler. My appearance oscillates between all possible features, creating this... blurred mess here.

I'm heading to Northern Algol because I heard rumors about another faceless individual lurking somewhere there. It's not such a common occurrence, you know? I feel it could be connected with my past.

I was almost killed by a man without a face, during the fire at the Bonzaga mansion in Euterpe... but that was not you, this is for sure. I thought you could have been connected to him.

So, fate has arranged for our meeting. Curious how things turn out sometimes.

To be honest, I was tailing you through a... friend, if we can call him like this. I knew beforehand that you would have come here.

Good. Let's head for Northern Algol together, then. St.~ Patrick is right ahead, If we keep on driving at this pace, we should reach our destination in around three or four hours, just after sunset.
