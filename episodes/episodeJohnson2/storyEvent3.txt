This place... it's like the Witch Tower in New Langdon. Well, except for that giant flower wrapped around the castle.

It's not that surprising, Johnson. There are seventeen Witch Towers around the world, all built by the same guy about thirty years ago.

Still, I agree that the flower is... impressive. I've always thought that the blood flowers created by Rosenmaester were smaller.

They are mutant blood-sucking flowers. Maybe they degenerated over time.

We were already reckless enough to come here at night, we shouldn't take other unnecessary risks. Maybe we could come back tomorrow.

I haven't got anything to lose, Miss Husler. I'm here to find that "man without face" before he disappears again. Night or day doesn't make any difference, as long as I can find them.

Okay, listen Johnson: We already went through one fifth of the city, but aside from the carcasses of some wild animals, we didn't find any signs of life. Maybe our sources were wrong and we are just losing time.

The Witch Tower in New Langdon is the place where I lived until recently. If I and that faceless guy are even remotely similar, maybe...

Oh, sure. Well, let's believe in mysticism, coincidence and serendipity, then! Why not?

Hey, sis... isn't that THAT woman?

Good evening, ladies. I don't believe you are here by chance, so I'll go straight to the point: Do you happen to know a person without a face, just like me?

Good grief. It appears you are not so welcome, Miss Husler. I fear we will have to get information the hard way.
