Three or four hours was, unfortunately, a pretty optimistic estimate. We ended up needing almost twice as long.

There is only one path piercing through the Dead Zone Wall, and that path has a single checkpoint: the dome city of St.~ Patrick.

There is no other way to exit the Dead Zone. At least, not without being gunned down by the automatic heavy artillery system which keeps the Haemophages at bay. In other words, you are forced to pass through the city.

In any case, we managed to exit the city in the late evening, when the sun already settled. We could have waited for tomorrow, true, but none of us wanted to spend the night under the SHIELD. This city is way too creepy, as they are its inhabitants.

They were standing proud in the silence of the night, bathed in the ominous light of the full moon, as the ghost city was eagerly waiting for us to come.
