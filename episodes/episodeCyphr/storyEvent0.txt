It was 2055. I was nine, at that time.
I had already lost both my arms and my right ear, plus some of my internal organs.
Yeah, I was something like spare parts for my grandpa. Not funny at all.

To add insult to injury, grandpa was the boss of some local mob.
I was going to be vivisected to extract some hi-tech crap that he put inside me to transport it safely in secret.
I was basically screwed.

Then, a miracle happened. The bounty hunter called "Der Wolf" saved me, killing all of grandpa's henchmen, down to the last one.

This was all but useless. Unbeknownst to us both, "Der Wolf" was my mother, his daughter. The daughter he slaughtered because she married a cop.
Threatening me in front of her was definitely not a wise move.
