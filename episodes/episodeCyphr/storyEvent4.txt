Ok, it's enough. Good job, Cyphr.
Still, I'm not completely convinced that Colder will be easy to handle.

The target will most likely show up this evening at the night club. Dress casually, but wear your battle gear.
Try being friendly, before resorting to violence.

Remember that our goal is to make him join our team, while covering this up as an "arrest"... not to straight up beating him into a pulp, okay?

Mr.~ Daevka, the owner of the club, is an old greedy bastard from EXODUS, and he'll probably have a heart attack if you break too much stuff.

Yes. If the target manages to run away, at least tell him that an outlaw robot has been spotted here in New Langdon. And was looking for a sharkman.

It seems like you have more intel than me on the topic. As you know, Northern Algol is a ghost city.
I don't have any reports from there. I'll try to gather information on this robot, if it's important to you.
