Something that has to do with the Black Lightning, that's for sure. Something that only Bonzaga and his henchmen could have access to.

Donner didn't go to the party at the Bonzaga mansion with the sole intent of retrieving Mayer's brain.

Now that you make me think about it... there was something puzzling about how those two referred to me, when we met.

They were SURE I saw them do... something. Maybe this is it? They killed Bonzaga and set fire to the villa BEFORE Donner arrived?
