I just played the role, because I needed access to the party at the Bonzaga mansion. The information I gathered pointed at you as the best choice, as you are... easy to manipulate, we can say. Still, I haven't lied about my target.

There is a small private airport owned by Mr.~ Daevka we can have access to. A helicopter will take us there, and we'll be able to take off for Italy. We should be able to arrive before dawn, have some rest, and head for the city centre.
